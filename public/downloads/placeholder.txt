This is a placeholder file. In a real setup, you would place your application installers here:

- NepalBooks-1.0.2-win.exe
- NepalBooks-1.0.2-mac.dmg
- NepalBooks-1.0.2-linux.AppImage

These files would be referenced in your release JSON files and downloaded by the application when updates are available.
